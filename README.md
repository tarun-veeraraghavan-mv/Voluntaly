Voluntary is the best dashboard management app for small and large volunteering or non profit organizations. Using this app you can easily add, delete and track different campaigns, set different tasks that needs to completed for each campaigns and maintain different users. For instance, the demo user in this app runs 7 different campaigns, maintaining over 50 users, and tracking different tasks. The user is welcomed with a brief overview of different analytics of the app. Made with supabase and react and react query to manage the remote state, this app is  not only blazing fast but also intuitive and highly interactive. I have improved performance by over 27 percent by migrating the project from redux to react query
